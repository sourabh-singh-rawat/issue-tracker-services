# Pine agent rules

Canonical project instructions for coding agents (Grok, Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, etc.).
Skills with deeper recipes live under `tools/ai/*/SKILL.md` (loaded via `.grok/config.toml`).

## Database migrations — do not generate

**Never generate, create, rewrite, or apply database migrations on your own.**

That includes, without an **explicit** user request in the current turn:

- Running `db:generate`, `dev:db:generate`, `drizzle-kit generate`, or any turbo/`pnpm` script that generates SQL migrations
- Running `db:migrate`, `db:push`, or equivalent apply/push commands
- Hand-writing or editing files under any service’s `drizzle/` folder (`.sql`, `meta/*_snapshot.json`, `_journal.json`, etc.)
- Inventing migration filenames, snapshots, or journal entries to “finish” a schema change

When schema/table code changes require a migration:

1. Update Drizzle table/schema TypeScript only (e.g. `src/db/tables/**`).
2. Stop and tell the user that a migration must be generated.
3. Give the exact command for the service (from that package’s `package.json`), for example:
   - `pnpm exec turbo run db:generate --filter=@pine/<service>`
   - or `pnpm --filter @pine/<service> db:generate`
4. Wait for the **user** to run generation (or to explicitly ask you to run it). Do not run it yourself unless they clearly request that in the same conversation.

Schema/type changes without touching `drizzle/` artifacts are fine. Shipping incomplete schema work and leaving migration generation to the human is the intended workflow.

## Branches, commits, and changesets

When finishing work that should land as a PR:

1. **Base off `development`** (or the branch the user names). Create a **new branch** for the work; do not commit on `development` / `main` unless asked.
2. **One logical commit** on that branch for the change set (prefer a single clean commit over a noisy trail of fixups).
3. **Add a Changeset** under `.changeset/` in the **same commit**. CI requires one on non-draft PRs into `development` (skip only with label `skip-changeset`).
4. **Commit message and Changeset summary must match** and stay **concise** (same short line in both places).

Changeset file shape:

```markdown
---
"@pine/<package>": patch|minor|major
---

chore(scope): short summary matching the git commit subject
```

- Bump only packages whose published version should change. For docs-only / `.vscode` / tooling with no package version impact, use an empty frontmatter block (`---` / `---` with no package lines), same as existing repo examples.
- Filename: short kebab-case slug, e.g. `.changeset/vscode-remove-json-comments.md`.
- Do **not** commit unrelated dirt (e.g. accidental `**/__generated__/**` or local env). Stage only files for this change.

Example flow:

```bash
git switch development
git pull
git switch -c chore/vscode-remove-json-comments
# …edit…
# add .changeset/<slug>.md with summary == commit subject
git add <relevant paths> .changeset/<slug>.md
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
chore(vscode): remove comments from workspace JSON
EOF
)"
```

## Other guardrails

- Prefer filtered turbo builds/tests; full monorepo only when needed.
- Never hand-edit `**/__generated__/**` or `api-gateway/dist/*`.
- Do not search or edit `infra/data/` or `node_modules/` for product work.
- Use current packages only: `@pine/server`, `@pine/events` — not `server-core` / `event-bus`.
- Load the matching skill under `tools/ai/` for orientation, features, events, GraphQL, web, release, docker, k8s, or observability.
- **No comments in code.** Do not add `//`, `/* */`, or JSDoc unless the user explicitly asks. Prefer clear names and structure over explanatory comments.
- **Standalone functions are arrows; class methods are not.** Module-level and other standalone functions use `const name = (…) => { … }` / `const name = async (…) => { … }` — never `function` declarations. Inside classes, use normal methods (`method(…) { … }` / `async method(…) { … }`), not arrow property methods. Constructors stay as `constructor`. Interfaces/types express callables as properties (`name: (arg: T) => R`), not method syntax.
- **Public members first.** In classes and modules, put the constructor and public methods/functions above private/protected helpers. Keep the public surface at the top of the type or file.
- **Never use `as` or `any`.** Ban TypeScript type assertions (`value as Foo`, `as const`, `as unknown as T`, etc.) and the `any` type (`: any`, `as any`, `<any>`, `Array<any>`, etc.). Fix types properly with generics, narrowing, unions, `unknown` + type guards, `satisfies`, or correct library typings. Do not silence type errors with casts.

## Service method names — drop the repeated noun

When the type, class, or module already names the subject, methods are verbs. Do not repeat the noun.

| Do (on `IPlatformRoleService`) | Don't |
| --- | --- |
| `create` | `createPlatformRole` |
| `getById` | `getPlatformRoleById` |
| `list` | `listPlatformRoles` |
| `getPermissions` | `getPermissionsForPlatformRole` |
| `update` | `updatePlatformRole` |
| `delete` | `deletePlatformRole` |

Call sites already read as `platformRoleService.create(...)`. Keep a qualifier when there is more than one get/list (`getById` vs `get`, `getPermissions` vs `permissions`).

**Keep the noun** where there is no receiver and names share a flat namespace: GraphQL fields, event types, error classes, table names, public HTTP routes. `createPlatformRole` on the schema stays; only the service method shortens.

When editing a service that still uses the long form, rename that service’s methods and update its callers in the same change. Do not rename sibling services unless you are already in those files. Never rename GraphQL operations or event payloads as part of a service cleanup.

## Generated React Query hooks (web apps)

**Always use the generated hooks.** Never compose `useQuery` / `useMutation` with `*Options` helpers from codegen.

| Do                                                | Don't                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `useVerifyEmailQuery({ query: { … } })`           | `useQuery({ ...verifyEmailOptions({ … }) })`         |
| `useGetConsentChallengeQuery({ query: { … } })`   | `useQuery({ ...getConsentChallengeOptions({ … }) })` |
| `useAcceptConsentChallengeMutation()`             | `useMutation(acceptConsentChallengeMutation())`      |
| GraphQL: `useFindProjectQuery(vars, { enabled })` | Hand-rolled `useQuery` against the GQL client        |

- REST/OpenAPI: import `useXQuery` / `useXMutation` from `@generated/api/@tanstack/react-query.gen`.
- GraphQL: import `useXQuery` / `useXMutation` from `@generated/gql`.
- `*Options` / `*Mutation` factories are for non-hook use only (prefetch, queryClient, tests) — not for components.
- Do not re-wrap generated options with TanStack's `useQuery` just to pass `enabled` or similar; use the generated hook API (and GraphQL's second-arg options object when available).
- **Never destructure** query/mutation hook results. Assign the return value and read properties (`const userQuery = useGetCurrentUserQuery(); userQuery.data`). Enforced by oxlint `pine/no-destructure-query-mutation`.
